To test our push

CODING INSTRUCTION Git Flow: Create and Use different branch for working on different feature/task.

Send PR (Pull Request) to the dev branch.

Will review and approve or reject with reasons as the case may be.

Branch Flow: master: Contains the clean working code.

develop: Contains the code for the old api

dev: New feature_branch must be created from this branch

feature_branch: You must create a new branch when starting a new feature from the develop branch

          git branch dev

          git checkout -b feature_login
Good coding standard and structure should be adopted e.g Proper code committing

Please endeavor to ask if you need further clarification.

Thank You
